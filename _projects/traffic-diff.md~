As part of this work, we design, implement and
evaluate the first system and mobile app for identifying
traffic differentiation for arbitrary applications in the
mobile environment (i.e., wireless networks such as cellular
and WiFi, used by smartphones and tablets). The key idea
is to use a VPN proxy to record and replay the network traf-
fic generated by arbitrary applications, and compare it with
the network behavior when replaying this traffic outside of
an encrypted tunnel. We perform the first known testbed
experiments with actual commercial shaping devices to validate
our system design and demonstrate how it outperforms
previous work for detecting differentiation. We released our
app and collected differentiation results from 12 ISPs in 5
countries. We find that differentiation tends to affect TCP
traffic (reducing rates by up to 60%) and that interference
from middleboxes (including video-transcoding devices) is
pervasive. By exposing such behavior, we hope to improve
transparency for users and help inform future policies.

Our findings were published at IMC 2015. Check out [our paper] (https://people.cs.umass.edu/~phillipa/papers/traffic-diff_imc15.pdf)
